This is a full stack app using django and rest framework which has views for the backend user authentication with JWT access and refresh tokens.
In the frontend we use javascript and react  
We create an interceptor in user's requests so to add authorization headers after we get the token from Localstorage.
We create protected routes so that the user is authenticated when accessing certain pages. 
Some useful react concepts include :
Sates Useffect hook React Router Fetch data from apis Rendering them with jsx Props Drilling createContext hook Localstorage
